/*
Create a function that takes a string as a parameter 
and does the following, in this order:

Replaces every letter with the letter following it in the alphabet
Makes any consonants lower case
Makes any vowels capital

So, for example the string "Cat30" would return "dbU30" 
(Cat30 --> Dbu30 --> dbU30)

Note:
  the alphabet should wrap around, so Z becomes A
  in this kata, y isn't considered as a vowel.
